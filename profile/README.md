## 0day Zombies?

A term we use to describe the phenomenon of sudden and tragic events occurring repeatedly, much like relentless hordes of zombies. These events, often unexpected and devastating, can range from natural disasters like wildfires to cyber-attacks. The term "0day" highlights the unforeseen and immediate nature of these incidents, while "Zombies" signifies their relentless and overwhelming occurrence, causing significant disruption and harm.
