## What Does 0DAYZOMBIES Mean?

The term "0DAYZOMBIES" captures the essence of relentless and unexpected cyber threats. "0day" refers to zero-day vulnerabilities, which are security flaws that are exploited by attackers before they are discovered and patched. "Zombies" symbolize the persistent and overwhelming nature of these cyber threats, similar to relentless zombie hordes causing disruption and damage. Our name reflects our commitment to staying ahead of these threats by developing sophisticated defensive measures.
